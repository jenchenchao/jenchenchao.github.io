I am a PhD student in Sociology at Harvard University and a Doctoral Trainee at the Center for Population and Development Studies. I primarily use large-scale data and quantitative methods to study economic inequalities, with a focus on the roles of education, demographic changes, and the labor market. I also have a keen interest in understanding how social policies can reduce social inequalities. In my current project, I am investigating how changes in the distributions and economic rewards of different fields of study have shaped the gender wage gap in the U.S. My collaborative work examines multiple mechanisms through which secondary schools contribute to SES achievement gaps, as well as the joint effects of educational attainment and family structure on trends in income inequality.
