      How do schools affect socioeconomic inequality in academic achievement? Many studies have sought to characterize the role of education in the stratification system, but few have jointly studied multiple mechanisms by which schools reduce or increase inequalities. We propose a unified theoretical framework that integrates three potentially equalizing or stratifying mechanisms of an educational system: (1) unequal access to high-quality schools; (2) heterogeneous returns to attending high-quality schools; and (3) differential selection into high-quality schools by students' socioeconomic origin (SES). Applying a novel causal decomposition method to data from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey, we find about 17%-20% of the SES achievement gap can be explained by SES disparities in the attendance rate of high-quality schools. Moreover, attending high-quality schools is slightly more beneficial for lower-SES students, reducing around 7%-10% of the achievement gap. Differential selection into schools, however, explains only about 1% of the achievement inequality. The findings suggest, therefore, that unequal access to high-quality schools diminishes its equalizing power, and that redistribution of admissions to high-quality schools can help narrow the SES achievement gap.
